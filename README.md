## Installation Guide

Welcome to the NOIT project! Follow these simple steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you haven't, visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install them.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the NOIT project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run:

```

```


### Step 2: Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, you need to install the project's dependencies. This project requires installation in two directories: the main folder and the backend folder.

1. **Main Folder Installation**

   Navigate to the main project folder:

   ```
   cd path/to/noit
   ```

   Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Backend Folder Installation**

   Next, navigate to the backend folder within the project:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

   Run the npm install command again to install the backend dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Running the Project

After installing all dependencies, you are ready to run the project. Connect the phone with your local machine's network and start the project. Then scan the QR code.
